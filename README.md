# Chatbot Starter Template

A super minimal chatbot starter template in NextJS, using [Substrate](https://substrate.run). Built to be as concise as possible with few dependencies, so it's easy to fork.
- Renders streaming UI
- Handles chat history
- Modern, polished React UI with minimal dependencies

Right now it's food/cooking themed and can help you come up with recipes and cooking techniques, but it's easy to extend.
